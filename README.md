### Hi there I'am Diogo Cortez ðŸ‘‹

I work as junior php developer since January of 2020. It's my first job that I work as software developer :computer:  

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning the basics of AWS (Amazon Web Service), how to create a virtual machine, database storage, install applications and how the platform works in general (pricing, domain name system, security, storage). Besides that, I am studying CakePHP framework, OWASP top 10 and the best practices to write a clean code.

- âš¡ Fun fact: In 2010, I was a foreign student in Tucson, Arizona :us: where I attended Amphitheater High School as a Junior. In this year, I learned English and more about the american culture.
